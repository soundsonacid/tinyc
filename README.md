# tinyc

tinyc is a minimalist C interpreter written entirely in rust

the goal of tinyc is to build an interpreter with the following features in under 1,000 lines of rust code

1. basic types (int, char)
2. basic I/O (printf, read, write, open)
3. local variable declaration
4. arithmetic operators
5. relational operators
6. control flow (if, else, while, for)
7. arrays
8. functions (non-recursive)
9. structs
10. pointers

i am building tinyc to learn more about the "dark arts" side of programming

i hope that it will be able to serve as a resource to anyone looking to learn about interpreters
